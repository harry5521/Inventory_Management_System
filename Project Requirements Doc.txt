Got it — you basically want a **clear, role-based functional requirements document** for your Inventory & Invoice Management App, so you’ll know exactly *what* to implement for each role before diving into code.

Here’s a **structured breakdown** based on your roles (`Admin`, `Moderator`, `Manager`, `Employee`) and the typical scope of such a system:

---

## **📄 Functional Requirements Document — Inventory & Invoice Management System**

### **1. Core Modules of the Application**

Your app will have the following main modules:

1. **Authentication & Role Management**

   * Secure login/logout for each role.
   * Role-based dashboard UI and permissions.

2. **Inventory Management**

   * Add, update, delete products.
   * Track stock levels in real time.
   * Set reorder thresholds.

3. **Supplier Management**

   * Store supplier details.
   * Manage purchase orders.

4. **Sales & Invoice Management**

   * Create and send invoices.
   * Record payments.
   * Generate receipts.

5. **Reports & Analytics**

   * Sales reports, inventory reports, purchase reports.
   * Download/export data.

6. **Notifications & Alerts**

   * Low stock alerts.
   * Payment due alerts.

### **2. Roles & Their Functionalities**

#### **🔹 Admin**

*(Using Django’s built-in admin panel — no custom dashboard needed)*

* Manage all data in the system (CRUD on any model).
* Create/assign/remove roles for users.
* Full access to system configuration.
* View all system logs and audit trails.

---

#### **🔹 Moderator**

*(Middle role between Admin and Manager)*

* Approve or reject manager requests (like adding products, editing stock).
* Approve/reject large purchase orders.
* Monitor system usage and flag suspicious activity.
* View all reports but **cannot** delete critical records.
* Can disable/enable employee accounts.

---

#### **🔹 Manager**

*(Oversees operational flow)*

* **Inventory**

  * Add new products (pending Moderator approval if needed).
  * Update product details (price, quantity, supplier).
  * Remove/discontinue products (with approval if required).
* **Suppliers**

  * Add/edit supplier info.
  * Create purchase orders to suppliers.
* **Sales & Invoices**

  * Create customer invoices.
  * Record payments and mark invoices as paid.
  * Apply discounts (within set limits).
* **Reports**

  * View stock, sales, and purchase reports.
* **Staff**

  * Assign tasks to employees.
  * Approve employee leave/shift requests.

---

#### **🔹 Employee**

*(Day-to-day task handler)*

* View assigned tasks from manager.
* Update stock levels after sales or purchases.
* Create draft invoices (needs manager approval).
* Mark deliveries as completed.
* Report damaged or missing items.
* View their own performance stats (sales handled, tasks completed).

| Manage Suppliers          | ✅     | ✅         | ✅       | ❌          |
| Assign Tasks to Employees | ✅     | ✅         | ✅       | ❌          |

### **4. Implementation Flow Idea**

1. **Start with Authentication & Role Permissions**

   * Create a custom user model with roles.
   * Implement role-based middleware for access control.

2. **Implement Inventory Module**

   * CRUD for products (with approval logic where needed).

3. **Implement Sales & Invoice Module**

   * Draft → Approval → Final invoice flow.

4. **Implement Supplier Management**

   * Supplier CRUD and purchase order handling.

5. **Implement Reports & Alerts**

   * Use Django ORM queries for analytics.

6. **Finalize Role-Specific Dashboards**

   * Show only relevant data/actions per role.

If you want, I can now prepare a **developer-oriented step-by-step implementation plan** for these features so you know exactly in which order to code them. That would make building all these functionalities way easier.
