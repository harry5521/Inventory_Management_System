Got it — you basically want a **role–functionality blueprint** so you know exactly *what* to build and *who* (which role) will do it before you start coding.

Here’s how I’ll break it down:

---

## **Inventory & Invoice Management System — Functional Blueprint**

### **Core Modules**

Regardless of role, the system will have these main modules:

1. **Authentication & Role-Based Access Control**
2. **Employee & User Management**
3. **Inventory Management** (products, stock, suppliers)
4. **Order & Sales Management**
5. **Invoice Generation & Payments**
6. **Reports & Analytics**
7. **Activity Logs & Notifications**

---

### **Roles & Responsibilities**

#### **1. Admin (Superuser, uses Django Admin Panel)**

* **Full control over all data** in the system.
* Create/update/delete any record.
* Assign roles (Manager, Moderator, Employee).
* Manage system settings, permissions, and configurations.
* Access *all* reports and logs.
* Add/remove warehouses or branches.

> **You** will not code a custom dashboard for admin — they’ll use Django Admin.

---

#### **2. Manager**

*(Has a custom dashboard)*
**Responsibilities:**

* **Inventory:**

  * Add new products.
  * Update product details (name, price, stock level).
  * Manage suppliers (create, update, delete).
* **Orders:**

  * Approve/reject orders made by employees.
  * Assign orders to employees for delivery.
* **Invoices:**

  * Generate & approve invoices.
  * Apply discounts or adjust totals.
* **Reports:**

  * View daily, weekly, monthly sales.
  * Check stock reports (low stock alerts).
* **Employees:**

  * Create & manage employee accounts.
  * Assign tasks and monitor work progress.
* **Moderation:**

  * Approve changes made by moderators before they go live.

---

#### **3. Moderator**

*(Has a custom dashboard — limited version of Manager)*
**Responsibilities:**

* **Inventory:**

  * Propose new products or changes (sent to Manager for approval).
  * Update stock quantities for existing products.
* **Orders:**

  * Process orders placed by employees/customers.
  * Update order status (Pending → Packed → Dispatched).
* **Invoices:**

  * Create invoices but can’t approve final — must be approved by Manager.
* **Reports:**

  * View basic sales and stock data (read-only).
* **Moderation tasks:**

  * Review employee data entries before forwarding to Manager.

---

#### **4. Employee**

*(Has a custom dashboard — minimal tools)*
**Responsibilities:**

* **Orders:**

  * Create new customer orders.
  * Update delivery status of assigned orders.
* **Invoices:**

  * Generate invoices for their own sales only.
* **Stock Requests:**

  * Request restocking of products.
* **Customers:**

  * Add new customer records (basic info).
* **Reports:**

  * View personal performance stats (sales, deliveries).

---

### **Suggested Development Order**

To avoid chaos, build in this sequence:

1. **Authentication & Role System**

   * Create roles (Admin, Manager, Moderator, Employee) in DB.
   * Implement middleware or decorators for access control.
2. **Inventory Management**

   * Products, Categories, Suppliers, Stock levels.
3. **Orders & Invoices**

   * CRUD operations, status tracking, PDF invoice generation.
4. **Reports & Analytics**

   * Sales, stock, performance reports.
5. **Employee Management**

   * CRUD for employees (by manager/admin).
6. **Notifications & Activity Logs**

   * Email or dashboard alerts for approvals, low stock, etc.

If you want, I can now make a **clear table** mapping **Modules → Operations → Roles Allowed**, so you’ll have a quick “cheat sheet” for development.

Do you want me to prepare that? That will make coding order crystal clear.
